2. Copy the `obsidian.css` file from this folder

If you already have an obsidian.css file, delete that one, and copy paste this one instead.

you can only have one obsidian.css file at the time.

If you already had one, it's probably from the community themes.

Just keep in mind that you'll have to repeat the process to install this theme again.
